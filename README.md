# Is censoring in video games morally ethical?
##  How different cultures justify censoring video games and how this affects development practices.

The need for censorship of different forms of media is generally accepted by most societies. Usually, such censorship takes 
the form of limiting access of a certain group of people such as children, to a certain class of material, for example 
pornographic or violent video games.
In this essay I will look at how different countries censor video games and how this affects the development process and ethical
statements in different game studios. 
I will also discuss the reasons why some countries differ in what is allowed to be depicted in video games.
I will look at how different countries morally justify censorship and discuss whether or not video games are a form of art which
should be limited in principle to what they can portray.
How do different societies attempt to traverse the fine line between protecting it's citizens from inapproriate content and stifling 
creativity or overtly opressing its citizens.
