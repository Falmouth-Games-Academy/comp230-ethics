## Ethical modding and intellectual property protection.

Game modifications (mods) can undoubtedly offer great rewards to all parties.  For the modification developer, the opportunity to 'stand on the shoulders of giants' can easily and quickly enable a quality of product similar to the original game.  For the owner of the original intellectual property (IP), an inflated fan base can increase sales, market presence, and pave the way for new IPs; Team fortress, Counter-Strike, and Portal all began as mods for Half-Life.  
So why do many developers decide not to support mods?  Fuelled with anonymity, inappropriate content can hurt the IP owner's reputation, and distract from the developer's original design.  In some cases, mods are seen as IPs in their own right, and the question of who owns user-created content becomes prevalent.  
What alternatives are there to releasing a game's source code to the modding community, and what control measures, technically and legally, are there to protect the IP against unprofessional conduct and unethical content?  


Good topic. The question, as phrased, is a bit broad. Prediction accurate :-) 
Perhaps: "What makes a mod 'unethical' and what legal protections exist to police such unethical mods?" 
"What are the risks associated with nurturing a modding community, and how can game developers protect themselves?" 
There will be grey literature on take-down notices and some notable cases like Hot Coffee GTA you should draw your attention towards.
